# dyngpu

Dyngpu is a lightweight high-level renderer with a flexible API built on top of the `wgpu` graphics library.

### Usability

Dyngpu is currently not recommended for use in production applications. Moreover, the API is largely incomplete so the
user may have to supplement functionality using the `wgpu` library.
